    <h1>Scones</h1>
    <img src="../images/scones.jpeg">
    <p>The dreary weather in Britain makes scones the perfect go to breakfast or 
        mid-day snack.  What is more inviting than warming up with a blanket on the sofa
        with a warm scone and a cup of tea?
    </p>
    <p>Scones are easy to make but most importantly one must decide what to spread 
        on the inside or to drizzle on top.  Marmelade, butter, or variations of frosting
        can add a unique taste to the not so sweet scone.

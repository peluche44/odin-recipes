    <h1>Crepes</h1>
    <img src="../images/crepe.jpg">
    <p>Crepes are traditionally a French treat usually eating for snack time 
        in the afternoon.  Children love to eat Crepes filled with chocolate, 
        sugar, or jam.  They are like a much thinner pancake, although it is rare 
        to eat them with maple syrup.</p>
    <p>They are very easy to make and children enjoy helping out as well.  
        Come on and let's give it a try!</p>
